    "## Exercise 1: implementing `DummyClassifier`\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "rubric={autograde}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course (unlike CPSC 340) you will generally **not** be asked to implement machine learning algorihtms (like logistic regression) from scratch. However, this exercise is an exception: you will implement the simplest possible classifier, `DummyClassifier`.\n",
    " \n",
    "As a reminder, `DummyClassifier` is meant as a baseline and is generally a simple \"model\" you could \"fit\" to a dataset. All it does is predict the most popular class in the training set. So if there are more 0s than 1s it predicts 0 every time, and if there are more 1s than 0s it predicts 1 every time. For `predict_proba` it looks at the frequencies in the training set, so if you have 30% 0's and 70% 1's it predicts `[0.3 0.7]` every time. Thus, `fit` only looks at `y` (not `X`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find starter code for a class called `MyDummyClassifier`, which has methods `fit()`, `predict()`, `predict_proba()` and `score()`. Your task is to fill in those four functions. To get you started, I have given you a `return` statement in each case that returns the correct data type: \n",
    "- `fit` returns nothing\n",
    "- `predict` returns an array whose size is the number of examples\n",
    "- `predict_proba` returns an array whose size is the number of examples x 2, and\n",
    "- `score` returns a float\n",
    "\n",
    "The next code block has some tests you can use to assess whether your code is working. \n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest starting with `fit` and `predict`, and making sure those are working before moving on to `predict_proba`. For `predict_proba`, you should return the frequency of each class in the training data. **Your `score` function should call your `predict` function**. Again, you can compare with `DummyClassifier` using the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sklearn`'s `DummyClassifier` works when you have more than two classes, and also works if the target values are encoded differently, for example as \"cat\", \"dog\", \"eagle\", etc. However, for the sake of simplifying this question, we will consider **binary classification** only. Furthermore, we will assume that these classes are encoded as 0 and 1. In other words, you can safely assume that the variable y contains only 0's and 1's"

    "Sklearn provides a lot of useful tools like `make_pipeline` and `cross_validate`, which are awesome. But with these fancy tools it's also easy to lose track of what is actually happening under the hood. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute logistic regression's validation score on the first fold, that is, train on 80% and validate on 20% of the training data (`X_train`) without using sklearn `Pipeline` or `cross_validate` or `cross_val_score`. Store the score of the fold in a variable called `fold_score`. Recall that `cross_validation` in `sklearn` does not shuffle the data by default.    \n",
    "\n",
    "You should start with the following `CountVectorizer` and `LogisticRegression` objects, as well as `X_train` and `y_train` (which you should further split with `train_test_split` and `shuffle=False`):\n",
    "> Note: avoid assigning the variable names `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, `y_test` to your folds when you call `train_test_split`. You'll be using those again later in the assignment."

In CPSC 340, we would go all the way down into `LogisticRegression` and understand how `fit` works, line by line. Here we're not going into that at all, but I still think this type of question (and Exercise 1) is a useful middle ground. I do want you to know what is going on in `Pipeline` and in `cross_validate` even if we don't cover the details of `fit`. To get into logistic regression's `fit` requires a bunch of math; here, we're keeping it more conceptual and avoiding all those prerequisites."

The values are random, so it chooses random values and ends up being more efficient since it doesn't have to exhaust every value, whereas GridSearchCV will exhaust every possible value stated. Another advantage is that for high hyperparameter spaces, we don't want to search for the absoulute best hyperparameter combination."
